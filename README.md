# Classifier Explorer: Interactive Machine Learning Visualization

## Description

Classifier Explorer is an advanced machine learning tool designed to provide interactive visualization and analysis of various classification algorithms. Utilizing popular datasets, this application allows users to compare the performance of different classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Built with Streamlit, it offers an intuitive platform for both educational and professional purposes, enabling a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts.

## Features

- **Interactive Classifier Comparison**: Enables users to select and compare different classifiers.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust parameters like K for KNN, C for SVM, and max_depth & n_estimators for Random Forest via a user-friendly interface.
- **Dataset Flexibility**: Choose from Iris, Breast Cancer, Wine Dataset, and MNIST to test the classifiers.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Immediate visualization of classifier performance on the selected dataset.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Easy-to-navigate Streamlit interface for a seamless user experience.
- **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: Visualizes the data in two dimensions using Principal Component Analysis.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend Logic:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
